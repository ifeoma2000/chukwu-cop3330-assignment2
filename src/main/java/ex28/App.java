Exercise 28 - Adding Numbers
In previous programs, you asked the user for repeated input by writing the input statements multiple times. But itâ€™s more efficient to use loops to deal with repeated input.

Write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and computes the total of the numbers.

Example Output
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
The total is 15.

Constraints
The prompting must use repetition, such as a counted loop, not three separate prompts.
Create a flowchart before writing the program.

Challenges
Modify the program to prompt for how many numbers to add, instead of hard-coding the value. Be sure you convert the input to a number before doing the comparison.
Modify the program so that it only adds numbers and silently rejects non-numeric values. Count these invalid entries as attempts anyway. In other words, if the number of numbers to add is 5, your program should still prompt only five times.
